# Run Till Dawn

This is a repository for my Ludum Dare 55 submission titled "Run Till Dawn". In 2024 I performed all of the art and code work on this project within the 72 hour game jam time limit! The theme for this game jam was ***"Summoning"***. 

The most notable aspect of this game jam project is the procedurally generated levels that allow the player to input any (up to) 8 letter code. The lenghth of the code determinies the difficulty level and the code itself is enterly deterministic. This allows players to share the codes they enjoy! This project was also my first dive into ragdoll physics systems for some extra fun when the player crashes ;)

#### Run Till Dawn is a fast-paced downhill runner where you race down a mountain and towards the sun, hoping to stay in the daylight and escape the evils youâ€™ve just unleashed on the world.
